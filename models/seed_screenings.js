With only 1 respondent giving it other than last place (hat tip to Carmen) it easily supplants Sharknado and Ghost Dad as the most agressively down-voted selection in history. Bravo Nathan... bravo. \r\n\r\nPaul: Morning thought is that Crossroads was pretty bad and extremely dumb, but despite its horrible reputation it was not nearly as bad as the worst of the movies we’ve seen. Maybe not even in the top 3. John Carter and DC Cab were worse...maybe another one too that is even more forgettable.",

We are reaching out today with a long-awaited operational update: as of the end of this month, the Fortnightly Film Society finally will discontinue its remote participation functionality and will require that all members attend all screenings in person.  It was never represented that the pandemic-related telecommuting option would remain available indefinitely, and the FFS leadership believes strongly that the forced sharing of physical space is foundational to our company culture.\r\n\r\nFor its part, the Fortnightly Film Society's Shadowy Governing Brain Trust™ (Pat. Pend.) wholeheartedly welcomes this development, because it dearly has missed the playful banter that it used to share with The Fortnightly Film Society's Much-Vaunted All-Powerful Super-Computer (All Rights Reserved) in the Fortnightly Film Society's Restroom That Is Reserved for Super-Computers and Giant Brains!  Said Brain Trust is absolutely sure that each of you similarly yearns for the bonhomie and good cheer that may blossom only within a collegial, in-person film appreciation environment.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we look forward to seeing everyone at the AMC Classic Fort Wayne 20 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, at 8:00 AM on Saturday, June 5, 2021, for our first mandatory in-person breakfast*** screening of one of the worst movies ever made!  (No promises, but The Fortnightly Film Society's Much-Vaunted All-Powerful Super-Computer (All Rights Reserved) tells me it might be Gigli!)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nThe Fortnightly Film Society's Shadowy Governing Brain Trust™ (Pat.

Yes, it soon will have been one year since this oafish passel of vulgarians and philistines first convened to \"watch\" Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, and, by way of celebration therefor, the Fortnightly Film Society's Shadowy Governing Brain Trust™ (Pat. Pend.) proudly announces that -- as with our wildly successful BRIDESMAIDS EDITION VOL. I and VOL. II -- the winning film for this weekend's screening shall be chosen not from new nominees but rather via a Polltab-hosted bracket-style tournament comprising notable FFS nominees of yore!\r\n\r\nBut with a new twist!  As was ideated by one Nathan Freeman (and as was overwhelmingly endorsed by a spot poll of the membership), this time around, all eight nominees selected for reconsideration were originally proposed by the FFS's resident iconoclast and raconteur, Ben Beckley!\r\n\r\nSPECIAL ALL-BEN-BECKLEY-NOMINEES ANNIVERSARY EDITION\r\n\r\nWhere to Vote: https://www.polltab.com/bracket-poll/_LJgNYhB_I9",

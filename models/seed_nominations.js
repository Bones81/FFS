Laura Linney tightens her ponytail as heiress-archaeologist Dr. Karen Ross, Ernie Hudson chomps his way through 10,000 cigars as Captain Munro Kelly, and Tim Curry does career-best/worst work as mythology-hunting explorer Herkermer Homolka.

    "blurb": "...Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, a film perhaps most notable for being the big budget film that convinced Jake Gyllenhaal that he doesn’t like doing big budget films. It is why he’s mostly done smaller, artistic films ever since (2019’s Spider-Man: Far from Home notwithstanding), despite his prodigious blockbuster-helming potential. \r\n\r\nAlso of note: Islamic architectural hallmarks appear, despite the plot being set roughly 1600 years before the rise of Islam! Could our beloved Vaguely Eastern Wailing be far behind??\r\n\r\nAnd, while it’s no Super Mario Brothers starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo, it is based on a video game, making it automatically qualify as a boondoggle in my book. \r\n\r\nIf stupid boondoggles are our game, Prince of Persia should be what we name!!

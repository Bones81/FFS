I know he’s old, he’s sexually motivated, and he’s on the You’re So Vain suspect list. That’s okay. I’ve driven further on less gas. From what I can tell, this is why he was born. He was born to direct and star in Dick Tracy. This movie would slide unacceptably far into parody if the director wasn’t playing Dick Tracy and didn’t believe that Dick Tracy was the coolest man who ever existed in either reality or fiction. The amount of trust this movie places in you to understand that it’s funny is dead now. If Dick Tracy was made in 2020 It would be directed by Taika Waititi and would star Chris Hemsworth and we would hear Dick Tracy say “that’s not a thing.” I realize I’m coming perilously close to romanticizing the past and falling headfirst into becoming a reactionary but don’t worry. I don’t think all hope is lost. We’re in a bad moment but I think there’s a way out. The UCB theater going out of business fills me with hope.",

(Don’t try looking for it on Wikipedia, just trust me.) It is a beautiful country, full of wonder, mystery, and gymnastics equipment randomly built into everyday objects. Walls have parallel bars and, yes, a town well has two pommel horse handles. I mean how else was Jonathan Cabot (Olympic gymnast turned semi-professional actor Kurt Thomas) supposed to use his incredible athletic abilities? Technically, Gymkata does offer a reason for this curious construction choice. The pommel well is situated inside the “Village of the Crazies,” a municipality in which everyone is, well, crazy. So of course they put a pommel horse in a well; these people are crazy! (Why a country would build/designate an entire town for insane people is a question left resolved.) Directed by Robert Course (who, in happier times, also made Enter the Dragon), Gymkata is the Holy Grail of bad action movies: Occasionally thrilling, frequently unfathomable, and perpetually hilarious. It’s also a hell of a tourism video for Parmistan.\"",

I can of course appreciate the use of phrases such as \"holiday edition\", as well as the inclusion of movies that explore alternate universe versions of beloved historical figures, as attempts to promote inclusivity in our Esteemed Society. However, after reviewing the list of films that have been nominated up to this point, I can comfortably say that each and every one of them is a film that explicitly celebrates the Christian tradition at the expense of marginalizing the lived experiences of the entire human family.  \r\n\r\nAs global citizens, we bear the honor and the responsibility of constantly asking ourselves, \"Am I doing enough to empower my fellow person? Yes, I tell them that I love them, but do I speak from an ivory tower, or do I also plant my feet in the soil with them, and listen?\"\r\n\r\nWhen we muster up the courage to ask ourselves these and other uncomfortable questions, and even more, to accept that, no, we haven't done enough, we may then find the resolve to say that, yes, we will do more!\r\n\r\nPlease know that this is not a lecture! I recognized and felt compelled to speak out about this shortcoming not because I am above it, but because I have made similar mistakes.\r\n\r\nIn recent holiday seasons, I have made efforts to broaden my horizons and deepen my understanding of my fellow persons (and myself) by studying celebrations of the holiday season across the world. While some of these traditions are as well-known as Christmas, others have hardly reached those of us in the so-called \"Western world\" (and rest assured, we are the poorer for it). \r\n\r\nThe celebrations of the Jewish festival of \"Hanukkah\" stand out as uniquely well-suited to the needs of this FFS. I think we can all benefit immensely from viewing a film that dives into the origins and history of this tradition, and I'm confident that such an experience will teach us how to celebrate more inclusively.\r\n\r\nIt is with these thoughts in mind that I present my nomination for the FFS viewing scheduled for Saturday, December 19th, 2020",

    "blurb": "I think maybe someone nominated this in a previous year, but after reading the below description, you will see this film clearly merits reconsideration:\r\nElves, 1989\r\n\r\n'Elves is a perfect storm of everything that could conceivably go wrong while shooting a movie all going wrong at the same time. It’s got everything: Anti-Christmas witches, neo-Nazi scientists, inarticulate elf puppets and a plot to bring about a “pint-sized master race” by breeding Nazi elves with a virgin. The characters are awesomely ludicrous, none more so than Dan “Grizzly Adams” Haggerty who plays an alcoholic bum/mall Santa/former mall-cop/former private eye who also happens to recognize symbols scrawled on the ground in blood thanks to “a book in college I remember on mystical symbols and runes.” Stumbling onto filmmaking this sincere but inept is like winning the bad movie lottery.\r\nMost festive offense: There’s a dozen great moments you could choose, but I love when Haggerty barges into a professor’s home during Christmas dinner and makes the guy (dressed like the conductor from Shining Time Station) explain “the connection between the elves and the Nazis.” There’s an amazing cutaway shot to the professor’s two little girls staring intently up at him right at the moment he starts talking about the genetic properties of elf sperm.'",

Being that the rules wouldn't let Paul nominate the movie, we did what any good power couple would do and flouted them. For that, I am sorry.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, holy hell those wheelies. I had forgotten them, and thanks to Jeff, they have come squeaking back into my consciousness. It definitely violates Ziemba Content Protocol or whatever it's called. There are enough terrible images from 2020 to sear into our children's minds; we need not add to them.\r\n\r\nLest we dare each other into voting for it, or risk Ranked Choice Sorcery somehow causing a Brexit-style calamity ahead of our Bad Movie Night, I hereby move to withdraw my poorly considered nomination.\r\n\r\nBrain Trust response: Withdrawal accepted given that Return to Oz may violate The Fortnightly Film Society's Amalgamated and Consolidated Ziemba Protocols re: Suitability of Audiovisual Content for Viewing by Children™, but I would like to eulogize Emily's choice and to say that I probably would have picked it as my #1.  I've never seen it and it looks like some truly weird shit.  Also, although X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Batman & Robin are both camp classics (more than comic book movies), I applaud Return to Oz for being based not on some heavily corporatized Marvel or DC bologna but rather on the type of totally bananas early-to-mid-20th century pulp fantasy / sci-fi property that has arisen time and time again in the Fortnightly Film Society's august rosters of winners and nominees (see also John Carter, Flash Gordon, Barbarella, Dick Tracy, Valerian and Laurentine, James Bond, The Lone Ranger, The Phantom, The Shadow, and others).

Paul mentioned Popeye over text recently and now I can't stop thinking about it.\r\n\r\nOriginally released on December 6, 1980, Popeye is the story of a deranged, alternate-universe Santa Claus (Paul L. Smith) who repurposes his elf helpers into a private navy and relocates his operation from the North Pole to a ramshackle American seaside town during the 20th century's Interwar Period.  When this wild-eyed and dyed-bearded Santa threatens to take over the world, Mrs. Claus (Shelley Duvall) hires a seafaring renegade elf (Robin Williams) to remind him of the true meaning of Christmas.",

The plot feels like someone took The Nutcracker ballet, sent the script through an office shredder, and then attempted to piece all the bits back together again in random order on the day that filming began. The tone is legitimately bizarre, somewhere between 'war film' and 'family comedy,' alternating between horrifying rat men in Nazi uniforms and Nathan Lane in a fright wig and a German accent. It maintains a perfect 0% on Rotten Tomatoes and caused Roger Ebert to wonder: 'From what dark night of the soul emerged the wretched idea for The Nutcracker in 3D?'\r\n\r\nMost festive offense: Nazi Rat King John Turturro summons a horn band out of thin air and performs a jazzy number about evil while electrocuting a shark to death for fun. This is a real thing that happens in The Nutcracker in 3D. A shark is electrocuted to death during a music number.\"\r\n",
